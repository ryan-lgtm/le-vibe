# Lé Vibe Native Agent Extension (scaffold)

This package is the first-party extension scaffold for the Lé Vibe native extension track.

## Scope for task-n1-1

- Extension host entrypoint exists (`extension.js`).
- Lé Vibe branded command is contributed:
  - `leVibeNative.openAgentSurface`
  - Command palette title: `Lé Vibe: Open Agent Surface`
- Activation events include startup and command-triggered activation.

## Startup readiness panel (task-n1-2)

The extension now renders a deterministic readiness panel with explicit states:

- `checking`
- `ready`
- `needs_ollama`
- `needs_model`
- `needs_auth_or_setup`

Every non-ready state includes at least one remediation action button:

- Ollama setup help
- local model install steps
- workspace setup workflow opener

During `n1-2`, readiness state is driven by `leVibeNative.devStartupState` so UX behavior is deterministic before live health wiring in `n2`.

## Prompt streaming (task-n2-2)

The panel includes a basic local prompt test surface:

- Send prompt to local Ollama streaming endpoint.
- Render streaming token output directly in the panel.
- Cancel in-flight request with a dedicated button.
